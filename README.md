# Amsterdam Street Ages Project

The Amsterdam Street Ages Project - or ASAP, if you like - tries to date Amsterdam streets. If we know when streets were constructed (and, in some cases, demolished), we could create maps of the city for any given year. Also, we could validate other data and query within a temporal context.

## Sources

Sources that help determine the periods of construction are raadsbesluiten, transportakten, BAG, dated cultural heritage objects and, of course, maps. More on these sources in the [sources folder](sources).
